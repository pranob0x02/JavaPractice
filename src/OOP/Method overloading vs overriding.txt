-> Method overloading means providing two ro more separate methods, in a class
   with the same name but different parameters.

   we can overload static or instance methods.
   - often referred as compile-time polymorphism.


-> Method overriding means defining a method in a child class, that already exists in the parent class,
   with the same signature (same name, same arguments).

   - this is known as Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method dispatch,
     because the method that is going to be called, is decided at runtime, by the java virtual machine.

   - when we override a method, it's recommended to put @override, immediately above the method definition.
   - we can't override static methods, only instance methods can be overridden.
